#### Deployment
---
Website was written using PyCharm IDE, incorporating the technologies listed above. Every step of the project was commited to GITHUB, I have used Heroku to deploy it. The website can be found here: [Link preview](https://dungeonanddragons-thirdproject.herokuapp.com/).

I have commited each change to GITHUB by using feature to commit and push on PyCharm.

To deploy the app I have used Heroku.
1. Create the App Heroku
2. Set the Host
3. Create a Procfile Heroku
4. Push my Github Repo to Heroku to Deploy

MONGOURI connection string was set on Heroku to prevent it to be show on app.py file, which would be available in github.
