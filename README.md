Work based on other code
My code was first based on the previous Thorin&Company website, Task Management and Chat.

What changed after the user design experience (UDX) phase
I planned on using Parallax Scrolling effect, dividing the website by section, however I released I had too much content, and it would require from the user to scroll down constantly and it could result in a bad user experience. So I decided to divide index page into 2 sections About me and Subscribe.

Deployment
Website was written using Cloud9 IDE, incorporating the technologies listed above. Every step of the project was commited to GITHUB, it was made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found here: Link preview.

I have commited each change to GITHUB by doing the following into the terminal:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/luziandrade/milestone_project_mytravels
git push
github username
github password
